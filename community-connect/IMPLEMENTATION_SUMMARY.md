# Chat Email Notification System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Completed

Successfully implemented a comprehensive email notification system for the chat feature with the following requirements:

- ✅ **Send emails to all chat participants** when new messages are posted
- ✅ **30-minute rate limiting** to prevent spam (only once every 30 minutes per recipient per chat)
- ✅ **Exclude the message sender** from receiving notifications
- ✅ **Include companies and users** in notifications
- ✅ **Use the same email infrastructure** as the 2FA system
- ✅ **Pass NPM build** without errors
- ✅ **Handle all edge cases** with robust error handling
- ✅ **Ensure flawless user experience** with graceful degradation

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created
1. **`scripts/setup-email-notifications.js`** - Database setup script for indexes
2. **`tests/chat-email-notifications.test.js`** - Comprehensive test suite
3. **`CHAT_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS.md`** - Complete documentation

### Files Modified
1. **`lib/emailUtils.js`** - Extended with chat notification functions
2. **`pages/api/chat/messages.js`** - Added email notification triggers
3. **`package.json`** - Added setup script for email notifications

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Features Implemented

#### 1. Email Notification System
- **Function**: `sendChatNotifications()` in `emailUtils.js`
- **Triggers**: Automatically after successful chat message posting
- **Recipients**: All opportunity participants (users + companies) except sender
- **Content**: Professional email with message preview, sender info, and opportunity details

#### 2. Rate Limiting (30 minutes)
- **Database Collection**: `emailNotifications` tracks last notification times
- **Logic**: Prevents emails if sent within last 30 minutes per recipient per chat
- **Cleanup**: TTL index automatically removes old records after 7 days
- **Failsafe**: If rate limiting check fails, emails are sent (better safe than sorry)

#### 3. Participant Discovery
- **Companies**: Identified via opportunity's `companyId`
- **Users**: Found by checking `commitments` array for the opportunity
- **Exclusion**: Sender email is excluded from recipient list
- **Validation**: Handles missing users, companies, or invalid data gracefully

#### 4. Email Template
- **Subject**: `"New Message in [Opportunity Title] Chat"`
- **Content**: Professional HTML template with:
  - Branded header with gradient styling
  - Personalized greeting
  - Message preview (first 100 characters)
  - Opportunity details (name, date, location)
  - Call-to-action button to return to platform
  - Rate limiting notice in footer

#### 5. Error Handling
- **Chat Resilience**: Email failures don't break chat functionality
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing data handled without crashes
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Recovery**: Automatic retries and fallbacks where appropriate

### Database Schema

#### `emailNotifications` Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  opportunityId: ObjectId,     // Reference to the chat opportunity
  recipientEmail: String,      // Email of the recipient (normalized lowercase)
  lastSentAt: Date            // Timestamp of last notification sent
}
```

#### Optimized Indexes
- **Compound Index**: `{opportunityId: 1, recipientEmail: 1}` - O(log n) rate limiting lookups
- **TTL Index**: `{lastSentAt: 1}` with 7-day expiration - Automatic cleanup
- **Performance Index**: `{lastSentAt: 1}` - Time-based query optimization
- **Lookup Index**: `{recipientEmail: 1}` - General email queries

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### Comprehensive Test Suite
Created `chat-email-notifications.test.js` with tests for:

1. **Happy Path**: Email sending to all participants except sender
2. **Rate Limiting**: 30-minute cooldown functionality
3. **Sender Exclusion**: Verifies sender doesn't receive their own notifications
4. **Error Handling**: Email failures, missing data, SMTP issues
5. **Message Truncation**: Long messages properly truncated in preview
6. **Database Operations**: Rate limiting records and cleanup
7. **Edge Cases**: No participants, missing opportunities, etc.

### Build Verification
- ✅ `npm run build` passes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript/ESLint errors introduced
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ New API endpoints included in build output

## 🛡️ Security & Performance

### Security Measures
- **No Sensitive Data**: Only public opportunity details and message previews
- **Authentication Required**: Email links require login to view full conversations
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents email system abuse
- **Input Validation**: All inputs sanitized and validated

### Performance Optimizations
- **Database Indexes**: All queries use optimized indexes
- **Background Processing**: Email sending doesn't block chat API responses
- **Connection Reuse**: Single SMTP connection for multiple emails
- **TTL Cleanup**: Automatic removal of old data prevents collection bloat

### Monitoring & Observability
- **Detailed Logging**: Success/failure rates, rate limiting actions
- **Error Tracking**: SMTP failures, database issues, missing data
- **Performance Metrics**: Email sending times, database query performance

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Email configuration (uses existing 2FA setup)
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Optional: Site URL for email links
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

### 2. Database Setup
```bash
npm run setup-email-notifications
```

### 3. Verification
```bash
npm run build  # Verify build passes
npm test       # Run test suite
```
