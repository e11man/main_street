# Group Signup Button Fix Summary

## Issue Description
When a PA (Peer Advisor) user clicked the "Group" button in the opportunities section, the modal was not appearing. Additionally, the group button had an icon that needed to be removed.

## Root Cause
The GroupSignupModal component was checking for `opportunity.id` but opportunities in the system could have either `id` or `_id` fields. This mismatch was causing the modal to not receive the proper opportunity data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Opportunity ID Handling (GroupSignupModal.jsx)
- Updated all references to `opportunity.id` to use `opportunity.id || opportunity._id`
- This ensures the modal works with opportunities regardless of which ID field they use
- Applied fixes in three locations:
  - API call for group signup
  - Current user commitment checking
  - Individual user commitment checking in the list

### 2. Removed Icon from Group Button (OpportunityCard.jsx)
- Removed the Icon component from the group button
- Removed the `flex items-center gap-2` classes since there's no icon anymore
- The button now only displays the text "Group" as requested

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
1. `community-connect/components/Opportunities/GroupSignupModal.jsx`
   - Fixed opportunity ID references in 3 places
   - Ensured compatibility with both `id` and `_id` fields

2. `community-connect/components/Opportunities/OpportunityCard.jsx`
   - Removed Icon component and its SVG path
   - Updated button styling to remove flex layout for icon

### Build Status
âœ… Build completed successfully with no errors
- Only warnings remain are for image optimization and React hooks dependencies
- These warnings do not affect functionality

## Testing Recommendations
1. Login as a PA user
2. Navigate to the opportunities section
3. Click the "Group" button on any opportunity
4. Verify the modal appears correctly
5. Verify the button only shows "Group" text without an icon

## Additional Notes
- The group signup feature requires proper PA authentication
- Users must have `isPA` or `isAdmin` flag set to true
- The modal will show an authentication prompt if accessed by non-PA users
