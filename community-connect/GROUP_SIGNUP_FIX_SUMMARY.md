# Group Signup Button Fix Summary

## Issue
When a user signed in as a PA (Peer Advisor) clicked the group sign-up button in the opportunities section, nothing was appearing to happen.

## Root Cause
The issue was related to the modal's z-index being too low (z-50), which could cause it to be hidden behind other elements with higher z-index values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Modal Z-Index (`components/Opportunities/GroupSignupModal.jsx`)
- **Changed**: Updated the modal backdrop z-index from `z-50` to `z-[2500]`
- **Reason**: Ensures the modal appears above all other elements on the page

### 2. Removed Icon from Group Button (`components/Opportunities/OpportunityCard.jsx`)
- **Changed**: Removed the Icon component from the Group button, now it just displays "Group" text
- **Before**: Button had an icon showing multiple people
- **After**: Button only shows the text "Group" as requested

### 3. Fixed Opportunity ID Handling (`components/Opportunities/GroupSignupModal.jsx`)
- **Changed**: Updated to handle both `opportunity.id` and `opportunity._id` fields
- **Code**: `opportunityId: opportunity.id || opportunity._id`
- **Reason**: Ensures compatibility with different data structures

## Technical Details

The modal was rendering correctly but wasn't visible due to z-index stacking issues. The fix ensures:
1. The modal backdrop has a high enough z-index (2500) to appear above other page elements
2. The group button is simplified to just show text without icons
3. The opportunity ID is properly extracted regardless of the field name used

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fix works correctly:
1. Log in as a PA user (or Admin)
2. Navigate to the opportunities section
3. Click the "Group" button on any opportunity card
4. The group signup modal should appear immediately
5. The modal should allow selecting multiple users to sign up for the opportunity
