# Opportunity Dashboard & Mobile Optimization Fixes

## Summary of Changes

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address the issues with new opportunities not showing up on company dashboards and mobile optimization improvements.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. New Opportunities Not Showing on Dashboard
**Problem**: Companies reported that newly created opportunities weren't appearing on their dashboard.

**Solution**: Fixed field name mismatch in `community-connect/pages/company-dashboard.js`
- Changed `opportunity.filledSpots` to `opportunity.spotsFilled || 0` 
- Changed `opportunity.totalSpots` to `opportunity.spotsTotal || opportunity.totalSpots || 0`
- This ensures compatibility with both the new API format (`spotsTotal`, `spotsFilled`) and legacy format (`totalSpots`)

### 2. Too Much Information on Opportunities Page
**Problem**: The main opportunities page was showing excessive details, making it cluttered and hard to scan.

**Solution**: Simplified `community-connect/components/Opportunities/OpportunityCard.jsx`
- **Removed excessive details**: 
  - Company contact information (email, phone, website)
  - Meeting point details
  - Contact person information
  - What to bring instructions
  - Special instructions
  - Arrival time details
- **Kept essential information only**:
  - Date (formatted as month and day without year: "Dec 15")
  - Start time (formatted as 12-hour: "2:00 PM")
  - End time (formatted as 12-hour: "4:00 PM")
  - Basic location with Google Maps link
  - Company name (if available)
  - Volunteer progress bar

### 3. Enhanced My Commitments Section
**Problem**: Detailed information was removed from opportunity cards but users still need access to full details.

- **Added comprehensive event schedule section** showing:
  - Date (formatted as month and day)
  - Arrival time
  - Start time
  - End time
- **Added detailed location & meeting info section** showing:
