## üìß Email Notification Details

   - Event title
   - Date and time
   - Location with Google Maps link
   - Description
5. **Host Company Information**: If available, includes:
   - Company name

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Modified Files:

**Frontend:**
- `components/Opportunities/GroupSignupModal.jsx`: Added PA self-signup UI and enhanced user experience

**Backend:**
- `pages/api/users/group-signup.js`: Enhanced to handle PA inclusion and send emails
- `pages/api/users/floor-users.js`: Enhanced sorting and filtering (from previous update)

**New Files:**
- `lib/email.js`: Complete email service infrastructure

### API Changes:

**Group Signup API (`/api/users/group-signup`):**
```javascript
// New request body format
{
  paUserId: string,
  opportunityId: string,
  userIds: string[], // Can be empty if includeSelf is true
  includeSelf: boolean // New parameter
}

// Enhanced response includes email results
{
  message: string,
  results: array,
  emailResults: array, // New: Email delivery status
  opportunityId: string,
  paUser: object
}
```

### Key Logic Improvements:

1. **Smart Validation**: 
   - Handles cases where only PA signs up (userIds can be empty)
   - Validates total spots including PA
   - Checks PA's own commitments and conflicts

2. **Email Integration**:
   - Fetches company details for rich email content
   - Sends bulk notifications efficiently
   - Handles email failures gracefully without breaking signup

3. **Enhanced UX**:
   - Real-time spot calculation including PA
   - Clear visual feedback for all selections
   - Smart enabling/disabling of signup button

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Validation

- **Authorization**: Maintained PA/Admin only access controls
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all new parameters
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of email failures
- **Data Safety**: No sensitive information in emails or logs
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in limits (max 10 users per signup)

## üéØ User Experience Flow

### PA Group Signup Process:
1. PA opens group signup modal for an opportunity
2. Sees all users with their dorm users listed first
3. Can optionally filter to show only dorm users
4. Selects desired users from the list
5. **NEW**: Can check "Sign myself up too" to include themselves
6. Sees real-time count of total selections (including themselves)
7. Clicks "Sign Up X People" button
8. **NEW**: All signed-up users receive immediate email notifications
9. Success message confirms signup and email delivery

### Email Notification Flow:
1. User receives professional email notification
2. Email includes all event details and company information  
3. Clear identification of the PA who signed them up
4. Contact information for questions or concerns
5. Professional branding maintains Community Connect identity

## üß™ Testing Considerations

### Test Scenarios:
1. **PA Self-Signup**: 
   - PA can sign themselves up alone
   - PA can sign themselves up with others
   - PA blocked if already committed or at max commitments

2. **Email Notifications**:
   - All users receive emails after successful signup
   - Email content includes all relevant details
   - Email failures don't break the signup process

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - No users selected but PA signs themselves up
   - Mix of users and PA signup
   - Email service unavailable scenarios

### Email Testing:
- Development mode shows console preview URLs
- All email content properly escaped and formatted
- Both HTML and plain text versions functional

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future development:
1. **Email Templates**: Admin-configurable email templates
2. **Email Preferences**: User opt-in/opt-out for notifications
3. **Rich Analytics**: Email delivery and engagement tracking
4. **Calendar Integration**: Add to calendar links in emails
5. **Reminder System**: Follow-up emails before events
