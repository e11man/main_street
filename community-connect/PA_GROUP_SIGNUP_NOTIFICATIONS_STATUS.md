## üîß Issue Fixed Today

**Problem Found**: Email configuration inconsistency that could prevent notifications from reaching real users in some environments.

**Solution Applied**: 
- Fixed email transporter configuration in `lib/email.js`
- Ensured consistent use of environment variables (`EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_PASS`)
- Prioritized real email delivery over test services
- Added fallback configuration for different setups

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Files Involved:
- `pages/api/users/group-signup.js` - Handles group signup and triggers notifications
- `lib/email.js` - Email service configuration and notification templates
- `components/Opportunities/GroupSignupModal.jsx` - UI for group signup

### Email Service Configuration:
- **Primary**: Gmail service using `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` environment variables
- **Fallback**: SMTP configuration using `SMTP_USER` and `SMTP_PASS`
- **Development**: Ethereal test service (when no real email configured)

### Notification Features:
- ‚úÖ Beautiful HTML email templates with professional styling
- ‚úÖ Both HTML and plain text versions
- ‚úÖ Complete event and company information
- ‚úÖ PA identification and contact details
- ‚úÖ Error handling (email failures don't break signup process)
- ‚úÖ Support for up to 10 users per group signup
- ‚úÖ Validation and conflict checking

## üéØ User Experience Flow

1. **PA Action**: PA opens group signup modal for an opportunity
2. **User Selection**: PA selects multiple users from their dorm/floor or searches globally
3. **Group Signup**: PA clicks "Sign Up X People" button
4. **System Processing**: 
   - Validates all users and spots available
   - Signs up all users for the opportunity
   - Updates opportunity capacity
   - **Sends email notifications to ALL signed-up users**
5. **Email Delivery**: Each user receives immediate notification with complete details
6. **Confirmation**: PA sees success message with signup and email results

## üìä Email Notification Results

The group signup API returns detailed email results:
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully signed up 5 out of 5 users",
  "results": [...],
  "emailResults": [
    {
      "email": "user1@example.com",
      "name": "User One",
      "success": true,
      "messageId": "<email-id>"
    },
    // ... more results
  ]
}
```

## üîç Verification Steps

To verify the feature is working:

1. **Check Environment Variables**: Ensure `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are set
2. **Test Group Signup**: Have a PA perform a group signup
3. **Check Logs**: Look for email sending confirmation in server logs
4. **Verify Delivery**: Check that users receive emails in their inboxes

## üìù Environment Setup

Ensure these environment variables are configured:

```bash
# Primary email configuration
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Optional fallback SMTP configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-pass

# Email sender address
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@communityconnect.com
```
