# Admin Console Users Loading Fix Summary

## Issue
The admin console was displaying "No users found" instead of loading users from the MongoDB database.

## Root Cause
The main issue was that the admin API endpoints were protected with JWT authentication middleware (`protectRoute`), but the frontend fetch requests were not including the authentication credentials (JWT token stored in HttpOnly cookies).

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Authentication Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Frontend fetch requests to admin API endpoints weren't including credentials
- **Fix**: Added `credentials: 'include'` to all admin API fetch requests in `pages/admin.js`

### 2. Updated Fetch Requests
The following functions were updated to include credentials:

#### fetchData function:
- `/api/admin/users`
- `/api/admin/blocked-emails` 
- `/api/admin/pending-users`
- `/api/admin/pending-companies`
- `/api/companies`
- `/api/opportunities`

#### Admin Action Functions:
- `addBlockedEmail()` - POST to `/api/admin/blocked-emails`
- `removeBlockedEmail()` - DELETE to `/api/admin/blocked-emails`
- `approveUser()` - POST to `/api/admin/pending-users?approve=true`
- `rejectUser()` - DELETE to `/api/admin/pending-users`
- `approveCompany()` - POST to `/api/admin/pending-companies?approve=true`
- `rejectCompany()` - DELETE to `/api/admin/pending-companies`
- `promoteUser()` - PUT to `/api/admin/promote-user`
- `deleteUser()` - DELETE to `/api/admin/users/{id}`
- `deleteOpportunity()` - DELETE to `/api/admin/opportunities/{id}`
- `deleteCompany()` - DELETE to `/api/admin/companies/{id}`

#### Modal Functions:
- `AddUserModal` - POST to `/api/admin/users`
- `AddOpportunityModal` - POST to `/api/admin/opportunities`
- `EditUserModal` - PUT to `/api/admin/users/{id}`
- `EditOpportunityModal` - PUT to `/api/admin/opportunities/{id}`
- `EditCompanyModal` - PUT to `/api/admin/companies/{id}`

### 3. Environment Configuration
- Ensured `.env.local` file has proper configuration:
  - `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB Atlas connection string
  - `JWT_SECRET` - For JWT token generation/verification
  - Admin credentials

### 4. Admin User Setup
- Verified admin user exists in database using `create-admin-user.js` script
- Admin credentials: `admin@admin.com` / `admin123`

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Admin logs in via `/api/admin/login`
2. Server generates JWT token and sets it as HttpOnly cookie
3. Frontend includes `credentials: 'include'` in subsequent API requests
4. Server `protectRoute` middleware verifies JWT from cookie
5. Admin endpoints return user data successfully

### Files Modified
- `community-connect/pages/admin.js` - Updated all fetch requests
- `community-connect/.env.local` - Ensured proper environment variables

## How to Test
1. Navigate to `/admin` page
2. Login with: `admin@admin.com` / `admin123`
3. Users tab should now show all users from MongoDB
4. All admin functions (add, edit, delete, approve) should work

## Authentication Requirements
- JWT token must be present in HttpOnly cookie named `authToken`
- User must have `role: 'admin'` and `isAdmin: true` in database
- All admin API endpoints are protected with `protectRoute(['admin'])` middleware

The admin console should now properly load and display users from the MongoDB database!
